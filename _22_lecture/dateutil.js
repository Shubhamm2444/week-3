1: The dateutil.js component provides a simple way to handle date input for tasks in your React MERN stack todo application.

  import React, { useState } from 'react'; // Import useState for state management

const DateUnit = () => {
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(null); // State variable for selected date

  const handleDateChange = (e) => { // Event handler for date selection
    setSelectedDate(new Date(e.target.value)); // Update state with selected date object
  };

  return (
    <div className="dateunit">
      <label htmlFor="due-date">Due Date:</label>
      <input
        type="date"
        id="due-date"
        value={selectedDate?.toISOString().substring(0, 10)} // Optional date formatting
        onChange={handleDateChange}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default DateUnit;


//2: Integration:
Import DateUnit in your addtask.js component.
Include the <DateUnit /> component within your form.
This will provide a date input field where users can select a due date for their tasks. You can then access the selected date from the addtask.js component's state (selectedDate) and send it to the backend API if needed.

3: Additional Considerations:
You might want to add validation to ensure the user selects a valid date.
Consider customizing the styling of the date input using CSS classes like .dateunit.
If you need more advanced date selection capabilities, explore libraries like react-datepicker.

* By incorporating dateunit.js in your React application, you can enhance user interaction by allowing them to specify due dates for their tasks.
