In a React full-stack application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), getting user input involves capturing what the user types or selects in the frontend (React) and sending it to the backend (Node.js) for processing and storage (MongoDB). Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1: Frontend (React):
* Components: We create React components that handle user input. These components typically utilize HTML form elements like input, select, or textarea to capture user data.
* State Management: We use React's state management to store the user's input within the component. This allows the component to react to changes in the input and update the UI accordingly.
* Event Handling: We attach event handlers to form elements. When the user interacts with the element (e.g., typing in an input field), the event handler is triggered and we can access the user's input value.

3: Sending User Input to Backend:
API Calls: To send user input to the backend, we make API calls from our React components. Popular libraries like axios or the built-in fetch API can be used for this purpose.
Passing Data: During the API call, we pass the user input data as part of the request body (usually in JSON format).

4: Backend (Node.js):
Express.js Routes: We create routes in our Express.js server to handle incoming API requests from the React frontend.
Request Processing: In these routes, we access the user input data from the request body.
Database Interaction: We use tools like Mongoose (an ODM - Object Data Modeling library) to interact with the MongoDB database, storing the user input data as new records.
