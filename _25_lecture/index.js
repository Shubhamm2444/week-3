import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './app';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);


* Explanation:
This file remains mostly unchanged, rendering the App component (now containing the routing configuration) as the root component of the application.

  
1:todoscreen.js and addtask.js:
These components likely remain largely the same, focusing on managing task data and rendering the todo list or add task form, respectively. They might not need significant changes related to routing.

2:dateutil.js (Optional):
This component provides a date input for tasks. It might not be directly affected by routing but could be used within both todoscreen.js and addtask.js.
