Introduction to Context in React MERN Stack Todo App (with taskcontext.js)
In React applications, Context provides a way to share data across components in a tree hierarchy without explicitly passing props through every level. This is particularly useful for managing global or application-wide state that multiple components need to access.

1:Context API:
React introduced the Context API as a built-in mechanism for context management. Here's how it might be applied in your MERN stack todo app.

2:Benefits of Context:
Avoids prop drilling: You don't need to pass task data down through multiple levels of components.
Centralized state management: The TaskProvider manages the task data in a central location.
Easier updates: Changes to task data can be made in one place (the provider) and reflected throughout the components that consume the context.

3:Remember:
Context is best suited for sharing global or application-wide data. For component-specific data, consider using props or state management libraries like Redux.
Overusing context can lead to complex dependency management. Use it strategically for data that needs to be shared across a significant portion of your application.

* By introducing context in your MERN stack todo application using taskcontext.js, you can improve code organization, reduce prop drilling, and simplify data management for task-related information.
