In a React MERN stack application, handling events involves capturing user interactions (clicks, form submissions, etc.) in the frontend (React) and triggering corresponding actions or updates on either the frontend or backend (Node.js). Here's a breakdown focusing on the provided files:

1:Frontend (React):
Event Listeners: We attach event listeners to React components using functions like onClick, onSubmit, onChange, etc. These functions are triggered when the corresponding event occurs (e.g., user clicks a button, submits a form, changes input value).
Event Arguments: Event listener functions receive an event object as an argument, which provides information about the event, such as the target element and any associated data.

2:addtask.js:
Likely handles user input for adding new tasks.
Potentially has an onSubmit event listener for the form submission, where you might:
Access the user-entered task description from the component's state.
Trigger an API call to the backend to create a new task.
Update the UI to reflect the added task (optional).

3:task.js:
Presumably renders individual tasks within the todo list.
Might not have specific event handling, but could display information based on props received from todoscreen.js.

4:todoscreen.js:
Manages the overall todo list.
Likely has event listeners for:
Adding new tasks (triggered by addtask.js submission):
Update the list of tasks displayed on the screen.

5:Deleting tasks:
Send a delete request to the backend API to remove the task from the database.
Update the UI to remove the deleted task from the list.

6:dateunit.js (Optional):
Handles date input for tasks.
Might have an onChange event listener for the date input:
Update the component's state with the selected date.
This date could then be passed to addtask.js when adding a new task.

7:app.js:
Likely serves as the main entry point for your React application.
Renders the top-level component of your application (e.g., TodoScreen).

8:index.css and index.js:
Handle styling and configuration for your React application.
index.js likely renders the root React component (from app.js) into the DOM.
