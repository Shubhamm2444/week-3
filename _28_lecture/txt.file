Weather App Project Description
This project is a basic weather app that displays current and forecasted weather information. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface with the following features:

1: Weather Display: Shows today's weather information including temperature, location, and description.
Forecast: Displays a simple forecast for the next two days with dates, weather icons, and temperatures.
Temperature Unit Toggle: Allows users to switch between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) for temperature units.

2:Technologies Used:
HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web page.
CSS: Styles the visual appearance of the elements (fonts, colors, layout).
JavaScript: Adds interactivity to the app, handling the temperature unit toggle functionality.

3:Possible Enhancements:
Weather Data API Integration: Instead of static data, integrate with a weather API to fetch real-time weather information based on user location.
Multi-Day Forecast: Expand the forecast to display weather for more days.
Detailed Information: Include additional weather details like wind speed, humidity, and chance of precipitation.
Search Functionality: Allow users to search for weather in different locations.
Responsive Design: Enhance the layout to adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Animations and Transitions: Add subtle animations or transitions for a more engaging user experience.
Background Image Selection: Allow users to choose different background images based on weather conditions.

4:Learning Objectives:
Understand the basic structure of HTML documents.
Apply CSS to style web pages.
Use JavaScript for basic interactivity.
Explore potential for integrating with external APIs.

5:Target Audience:
This project is suitable for beginners who are learning web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a practical exercise to build a user interface and implement interactivity.

Overall, this weather app project serves as a foundation for building more advanced web applications with real-time data and user interaction.


6:CSS (style.css):
(You'll need to create a separate style.css file to define the visual styles for the elements)
This file will contain rules that define the appearance of various elements like fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning.

7:JavaScript (script.js):
(You'll need to create a separate script.js file to handle temperature unit conversion and other functionalities)
This file will contain JavaScript code that interacts with the HTML elements to add dynamic behavior. For example, it could handle the temperature unit toggle button click event, convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and update the temperature values on the page.
